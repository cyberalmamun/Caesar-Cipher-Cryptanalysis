# Caesar Cipher Cryptanalysis
## Overview
This project explores the Caesar cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions. The project includes encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis.



## Cryptanalysis
- **Known-Plaintext Attack**: Explained with examples.
- **Ciphertext-Only Attack**: Implemented frequency analysis and brute-force attack.
- **Fundamental Flaw**: The limited key space of 25 possible shifts makes the cipher vulnerable.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Caesar cipher script: `python caesar_cipher.py`.
3. Perform frequency analysis: `python frequency_analysis.py`.

## Results
- Frequency analysis visualization.
- Successful decryption of ciphertext using brute-force and frequency analysis.
